 # Polymorphism#
def:- having many form.(Polymorphism means "many forms", and it occurs when we have many classes that are related to each other by inheritance.)
eg shape(round,triangle,sphare)
      water form(solid,liquid,gas)
It is two type.
1.Compile Time Polymorphism ->achive through (Method Overloading)
2.Runtime Polymorphism  ->achive through (Method Overridding)

1.Compile Time Polymorphism ->achive through (Method Overloading)
 -> In same class having same name of method.
->with different argument
     a) Number of Argument.
     b) Sequence of argument.
     c)Type of argument.
Program:

import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;

class Main{
    
    void A(String str)
    {
        System.out.println("a method");
    }
    void A(int a){
        System.out.println("b method");
    }
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        Main t=new Main();
        t.A(10);
        t.A("shyam");
    }
}

2.Runtime Polymorphism  ->achive through (Method Overridding)

-> In different class having same name of method.
->with different argument
     a) Number of Argument.
     b) Sequence of argument.
     c)Type of argument.
